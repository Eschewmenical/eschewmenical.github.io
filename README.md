Welcome to Eschewmenical, the blog for Christianity.StackExchange.com. This is a blog where we will explore different doctrinal perspectives on a variety of topics. Rather than trying to reconcile those perspectives into a single theology we will present each perspective separately so that the reader may fairly evaluate each position.
